## Building from Source

If you want to build the plugin from source:

1. Make sure you have [Bun](https://bun.sh/) installed
2. Clone the repository or download the source code
3. Navigate to the plugin directory in your terminal
4. Run the build script:
   ```
   ./build.sh
   ```
   
   Or manually:
   ```
   bun install
   bun run build
   ```
5. This will install dependencies and build the plugin
6. The built plugin will be in the `dist` directory

## Development

For development with auto-reload:

```
bun run dev
```

This will watch for changes and rebuild the plugin automatically.

## Usage

Once installed, you can use the plugin in two ways:

1. **Slash Command**: Type `/Convert URLs to Markdown` in a block that contains URLs
2. **Toolbar Button**: Click the "URLâ†’MD" button in the toolbar while your cursor is in a block that contains URLs

The plugin will automatically fetch the title of each URL and convert it to markdown format.

## Troubleshooting

- If the plugin doesn't appear in the toolbar, try restarting Logseq
- If URLs aren't being converted, check your internet connection as the plugin needs to fetch the title from the URL
- For any issues, please report them on the GitHub repository
